The Magical Zoo of Oz has three exhibits. Lions and tigers and bears, oh my!

Administration is always changing the schedule of each exhibit
and adding or removing events.The schedule will be updated accordingly. Each time this happens the 
Exhibit either has a decorator added or removed.
Administration may want to try  new events so creating a new event has to be easy.

If we have time, we should pass time into the constructor of each
Exhibit event. If we're sadists we could implement a sort of the linked list
based on time.

Each decorator should have a get description.
